abstract = "New York: Fuck You Press, 1965. First. From James Musser's description: \"Mimeographed sheets, stapled at the edge. The correct first edition. The legendarily rare Fuck You Press edition of this title published by Ed Sanders who abandoned the project before completion. According to Sanders \"maybe as many as ten or twenty\" copies were distributed before he halted publication due to Burroughs' dissatisfaction with the copy he'd received. Maynard and Miles state that \"a good early copy was secured by Bill Beckman,\" and that is the copy offered here. Bill Beckman was an artist from Texas who designed album covers for The Fugs, and a good friend of Sanders who regularly gave him copies of current Fuck You Press publications. This copy bears Beckman's ownership signature on the title page. If only 10 or 20 copies did exist originally, far fewer have been accounted for. We know of only 3 copies in private hands, NUC and WORLDCAT turn up no copies in institutions (though there is a copy at Northwestern), and we've never seen a copy offered for sale. The cover sheet has pulled loose from two staples, else fine with all of the illustrations pasted in. Housed in a handsome clamshell box.\""
